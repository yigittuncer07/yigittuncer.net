        <p>This is a quick tutorial for anyone who might want to build their own personal website, which is surprisingly
            easy and cheap. I'll also explain some basic concepts about how the web actually works. Here is the basic
            outline of what we will be doing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#domain">buy a domain name</a></li>
            <li><a href="#server">rent a web server</a></li>
            <li><a href="#link">link the domain to your server</a></li>
            <li><a href="#coding">create your website by creating some simple HTML and CSS files</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="domain">Buy a domain name</h2>
        <p>A domain is the thing you type in the search bar in your web browser to go to websites. For example, when you
            write www.google.com, you go to Google, or if you write yigittuncer.net, you get my website. I'll explain
            this concept better in the IP address section. For now, you need to choose and buy a name for yourself. I
            recommend using <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a> as that's what I used, but any domain name
            site will do. You can get better prices if you prefer .xyz or .net names instead of .com.</p>

        <h2 id="server">Rent a web server</h2>
        <p>Now we need to rent a web server. A server is just a computer that sends files to other computers. For
            example,
            when you go to google.com, you're actually connecting to a server that sends the page that loads in your
            browser to your computer. For a more in-depth explanation, you can check out this <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_web_server">link</a>.
            But you don't really need to understand this to build the site. Now for this step, you could rent a VDS
            (Virtual Dedicated Server), but those are expensive. I recommend renting a web server since they're dirt
            cheap. I use <a href="https://www.rabisu.com/en/">Rabisu</a>, but you can use any site you want. Just buy
            the web server pack (like <a href="https://www.rabisu.com/en/hosting.php">this</a>).</p>

        <h2 id="link">Linking the domain to the server</h2>
        <p>The web server you purchased has its own IP address, which is a bunch of numbers like 192.01.01.6. This
            allows
            other computers to communicate with each other. For example, as of the time I'm writing this, Google's IP
            address is <a href="https://142.250.187.142">142.250.187.142</a>. If you write this in your search bar or
            click the link, you'll go to google.com. If we didn't have domain names, we would have to memorize these IP
            addresses each time we wanted to go to a site. But thanks to domain names, we can just remember google.com.
            So now we want to link the domain name you bought with your IP so other computers know where to go when
            someone asks for your website. First, you need to get the IP of your website, which should be written on the
            site you bought it. Then, go to your domain name provider and go to the DNS settings. From there, you want
            to
            click on create a new record, then select type A for type, and enter the IP address into the data section.

        <h2 id="coding">Coding the website</h2>
        <p>At this step, if everything went okay, we actually have a website on the web! The only problem is there's
            nothing on there. We need to now need to create HTML and CSS files for the site. HTML stands for Hyper Text
            Markup Language, and it's just a language to make text look fancy. You can check out the HTML page for this
            page <a
                href="https://github.com/yigittuncer07/yigittuncer.net/blob/main/tutorial.yigittuncer.net/index.html">here</a>.
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and what it does is it adds style to webpages. So without CSS on this
            page, you would only see barebones text on a white page. You can see the CSS file for this page <a
                href="https://github.com/yigittuncer07/yigittuncer.net/blob/main/tutorial.yigittuncer.net/content/style.css">here</a>.
            Explaining what all this means would be out of the scope of this short guide, so I'll link to some useful
            documents to help you get started with creating your own idea of a webpage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML">HTML guide</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps">CSS guide</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>But for now, just create a file called index with the file extension .html, index.html. We don't need to
            worry
            about CSS for now. The index.html file is the first file that opens when you go to a website. For example,
            when you go to google.com, you'll land on its index.html page. Now open this file with any text editor and
            copy and paste the following code into it:</p>
        <pre>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my awesome webpage&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;
        </pre>

        <p>Now, save this file and upload it to your server. Open the file manager of your server and put the index.html
            file under the public_html folder. If you get stuck on this part, just look up how to upload files on
            whatever
            server provider you chose during step 2. Now when you load into your site, you should see this:</p>
        <img class="images" src="content/website.jpg" alt="website image">

        <p>All that's left to do is style your website to your liking. There is a lot more to learn about web
            development,
            but hopefully, this allowed you to create a basic site.</p>
